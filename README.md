# [![MEAN Logo](http://mean.io/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen-child/images/meanlogo.png)](http://mean.io/) MEAN<sup>2</sup>

#### The Full Stack Javascript Framework.

MEAN started out as a combination of MongoDB , ExpressJS , AngularJS and Node.js.   
With <strong>MEAN<sup>2</sup></strong> we are providing the ability to mix and match additional frontend frameworks, databases and technologies.
We aim to create a robust, flexible and scalable fullstack javascript solution

The default MEAN stack you get out of the box can work either with Angular or React and is built with the next technologies...

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular4 web starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Innograph](https://github.com/linnovate/innograph) (uses GraphQL for schema standartization)
* [Bit](https://bitsrc.io/) - (Manages js components, services and schemas)

If you're looking for the classic angular-1.x version of mean it has moved to this [1.x branch](https://github.com/linnovate/mean/tree/1.x) 

## Prerequisite Technologies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* [Node 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* npm 3.x ( or yarn)

> If you have an older version of Node.js and NPM , you can use Node Version Manager [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to use multiple node versions on your system. MEAN<sup>2</sup> only supports Node 6.x or higher versions.

## Installation

To start your application with MEAN, you need to clone the base MEAN repository from Github. This repository contains all the packages, modules and also sample code base in order to start and make it easy to develop your application. Following steps will guide you to install latest MEAN version.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/linnovate/mean.git  
cd mean
npm install  
npm start  
```
If all the packages and modules installed successfully, default web browser will open and you can see default MEAN application at `http://localhost:3000`. This is the default port unless you change that manually.

## Additional Tools used in MEAN

1. [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
2. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
