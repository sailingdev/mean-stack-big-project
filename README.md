# MEAN Stack

MEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications.  
It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with usefull modules like mongoose and passport prebundled and configured.  
We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.  

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - Make sure it's running on the default port(27017).

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [Package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Prebundled in the [public](public/) folder.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Prebundled in the [public](public/) folder.

## Configuration
See the [config](config/) folder and espically the [config.js](config/config.js) file.

## Quick Start

 The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

 Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

 Start the server:

    $ node server

## The Future
  We are currently working on a extendable module system to make this project more like a framework with support for common modren web development requirements.
